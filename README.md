# weather-app

This Weather App is a simple and interactive web application built using Flask, Python, the OpenWeather API, and Bootstrap for styling. It allows users to search for current weather conditions by entering a city, province/state, and country. Upon submission, the app displays the current temperature, weather condition, and an icon representing the weather. The application provides a clean and responsive user interface with real-time weather data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.
